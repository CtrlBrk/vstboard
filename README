How to build VstBoard :

Steinberg SDKs :
================
Steinberg Vst Sdk and Asio Sdk can't be redistributed : you have to create a free account and download them yourself.
we need "VST 2.4 Audio Plug-Ins SDK" and "ASIO SDK" available at http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html

from the Vst SDK : copy "pluginterfaces" and "public.sdk" to ./libs/vstsdk2.4.2 (see README.txt in that folder)
from the Asio SDK : copy "common" and "host" to ./libs/portaudio/src/hostapi/asio/ASIOSDK (see README.txt in that folder)

Qt Creator :
============
Download and install "Qt SDK for Windows (based on MinGW)" (the Complete Development Environment) from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

in Qt Creator, create a new session and open :
 ./src/vstboard/VstBoard.pro
 ./src/portaudio/portaudio.pro
 ./src/pormidi/portmidi.pro

- compile portaudio and portmidi
- you can now compile the VstBoard project
